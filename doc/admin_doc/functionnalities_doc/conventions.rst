General conventions
===================

*e* always represents the basis of natural logarithms.

*i* always represents the imaginary constant.

Do not use these letters to represent variables.

*log* means log base 10.

*ln* means natural logarithm.

*log_a* means log with base a.

Decimals are represented using a dot "." .

Separations are represented using a comma "," .

When a letter is followed by an opening parenthesis, it is interpreted as *function of...*
For example, *x(2y+3)* means *x* evaluated at *2y+3*
If you want a multiplication instead, use x*(2y+3) or (2y+3)x.
This helps differentiate variables and functions.
